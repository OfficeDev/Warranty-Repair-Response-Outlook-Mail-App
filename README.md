Warranty Repair Response Outlook Mail Add-in
=========================================
The Warranty Repair Response Outlook Mail add-in was a demo that Steve Lasker put together for TechEd 2014. 

This demo highlights how to show a Task pane in a mail based on finding the customer by the e-mails TO: and look up the customer in the third party sales system. In the task pane it pulls the information about that customer and gives them the ability to add a button to inject this information into the reply for the e-mail.

It highlights the power of building a Outlook Mail add-in in Visual Studio 2013.
